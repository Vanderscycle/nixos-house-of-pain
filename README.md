# NixOs House Of Pain

`Would it be the NixOS experience if I gave you all the answers in one, convenient place?` -hlissner

The way of NixOs is the way of pain and self-hatred. Don't bother asking for help, this pain is yours to enjoy.


## Programs
- [Waterfox](./waterfox)
- [Devcontainers-cli](./devcontainers)

### Lessons learned
- node2nix -i <input> -18 (don't forget the version) 
- the node-packages.json is not a carbon copy of a normal package.json but an array of js packages
- nix-shell -A @devcontainers/cli
